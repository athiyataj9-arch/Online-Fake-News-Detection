# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📖 Overview

Fake news and misinformation spread rapidly through digital platforms, making it difficult for users to distinguish between reliable and misleading information. This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**.

The system preprocesses textual data, converts it into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, and trains a classification model to detect misinformation with high accuracy.
