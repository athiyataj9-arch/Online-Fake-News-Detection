# 📰 Online Fake News Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to classify news content as **Real** or **Fake** by analyzing textual patterns and linguistic features. Such systems are useful in combating misinformation across digital platforms.

The model is trained on labeled news data and applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to transform raw text into meaningful numerical features for classification.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Load and explore labeled news datasets (`Fake.csv` and `True.csv`)  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Remove punctuation, stopwords, links, and irrelevant text  
3. **Text Vectorization** – Convert text into numerical features using **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorizer**  
4. **Model Training** – Train classification models such as **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes**  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Measure performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**

## 📊 Results

* Achieved reliable accuracy in distinguishing **Fake** and **Real** news  
* Demonstrated effective use of **NLP** and **ML** for text classification  

**Example Metrics (replace with your own results):**

| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 95%    |
| Precision  | 94%    |
| Recall     | 96%    |
| F1-score   | 95%    |
